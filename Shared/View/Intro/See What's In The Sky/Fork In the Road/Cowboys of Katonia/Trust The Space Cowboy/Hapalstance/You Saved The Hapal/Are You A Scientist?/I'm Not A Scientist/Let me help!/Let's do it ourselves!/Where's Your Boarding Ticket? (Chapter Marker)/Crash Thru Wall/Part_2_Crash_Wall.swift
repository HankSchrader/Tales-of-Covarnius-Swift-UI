Why did you ever think that this would be good idea?\n\nLuckily, none of you are hurt. Luna stares at you at you in bewilderment.\n\n“Well that didn’t work as planned,” Chrono says.\n\nYou sigh and look at Luna. “Well I guess we’ll try your plan!”\n\nYou help Luna squeeze through the bars of the cell. “Now go get the key!” you instruct Luna.\n\nLuna runs over to the desk, wagging her tail. “That’s it girl,” you praise, “fetch the key.”"
