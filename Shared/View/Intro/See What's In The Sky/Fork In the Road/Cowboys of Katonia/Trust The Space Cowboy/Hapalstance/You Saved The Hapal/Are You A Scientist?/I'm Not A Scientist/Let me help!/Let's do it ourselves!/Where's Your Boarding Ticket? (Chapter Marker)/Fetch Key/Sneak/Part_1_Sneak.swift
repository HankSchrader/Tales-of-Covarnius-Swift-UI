        "You dart behind bushes and trees, and promptly arrive at 99 Larblok Lane: Chrono’s house. Chrono sprints up the staircase, you and Luna follow closely behind. Peering out the window of his bedroom, you notice that Sinisterians are going door to door, rounding up all of the Covarnians.\n\n“They have Mr. Blarknark in chains!” Chrono cries, pointing to his neighbor about six doors down.\n\n“That means we don’t have much time to fix the machine. They’ll be here in about twenty minutes, if I were to guess,” you surmise.\n\nYou turn to the Hyper Growth Ray and realize that it might be a little more difficult to fix than you thought.\n\nIt looks like a telescope, but with a large dial on the side. Strange Covarnian writing is printed at different intervals on the dial. After asking Chrono, you discover it reads: Large, Very Large, and Humongous!"
