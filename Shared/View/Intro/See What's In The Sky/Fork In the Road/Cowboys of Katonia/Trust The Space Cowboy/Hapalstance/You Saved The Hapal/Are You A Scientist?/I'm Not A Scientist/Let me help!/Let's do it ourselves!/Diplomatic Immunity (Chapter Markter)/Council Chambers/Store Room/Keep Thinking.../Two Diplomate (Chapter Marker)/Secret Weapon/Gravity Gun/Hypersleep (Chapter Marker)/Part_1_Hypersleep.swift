The room is massive. Rows and rows of pods with sleeping Sinisterians fill the room. With this many Sinisterians, Covarnius doesnâ€™t stand a chance against an invasion.\n\nAlong one wall is a panel with monitors and other equipment. You walk over and try to decipher what all the knobs and dials are for. Each one seems to serve a different function such as nourishment or oxygen. None of them seem to be for ending hypersleep though.\n\nTime is of the essence, should you still go with this plan?"
