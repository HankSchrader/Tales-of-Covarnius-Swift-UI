        "You go with the Hypersleep release chamber idea. It seems like the idea that will buy Chono enough time.\n\nYou make your way to the door labeled Hypersleep Release Chamber and go inside. The room is massive. Rows and rows of pods with sleeping Sinisterians fill the room. With this many Sinisterians, Covarnius doesnâ€™t stand a chance against an invasion.\n\nAlong one wall is a panel with monitors and other equipment. You walk over and try to decipher what all the knobs and dials are for. Each one seems to serve a different function such as nourishment or oxygen. None of them seem to be for ending hypersleep though.\n\nTime is of the essence, should you still go with this plan?"
