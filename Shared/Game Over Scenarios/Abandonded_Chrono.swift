You see Chrono standing dejectedly below.\n\nIf only there was some way of stopping the Sinisterian invasion.\n\nAfter a brief nap in hypersleep, you wake up back on Earth.\n\nYou wonder whatâ€™s happening on Covarnius. Did the Sinisterians invade? Were the Covarnians able to defeat them?\n\nThe empty streets look the same as before. Cold and boring, but at least you're safe. You and Luna slowly walk back home.\n\nAs you look up into the clear night sky, you hope everything worked out for the Covarnians."
