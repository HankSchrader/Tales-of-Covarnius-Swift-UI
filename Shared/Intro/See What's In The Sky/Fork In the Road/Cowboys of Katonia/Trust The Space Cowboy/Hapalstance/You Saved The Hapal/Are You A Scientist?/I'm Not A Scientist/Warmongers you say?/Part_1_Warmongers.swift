What could possibly be done to help?\n\n Going home is clearly the wisest decision. But on the other hand, there is surely something that the Covarnians havenâ€™t thought of yet. Perhaps you should stay and try to help. You mull over the situation as you continue walking towards the shipping area. A decision needs to be reached as soon as possible.\n\n Chrono gives you one last, sad look. This is it. Go home or stay and help the Covarnians?"
